		  <h2> Taxonomy </h2>
		  
		  
		  <h3>In 1935, the British zoologist Reginald Pocock attributed the subspecies name Canis lupus arctos 
		  (Arctic wolf) to a specimen from Melville Island in the <a href = "https://ecoregions.appspot.com/"> Queen Elizabeth Islands</a>, Canada. He wrote that
		  similar wolves could be found on Ellesmere Island. He also attributed the name Canis lupus orion to a
		  Greenland wolf specimen from Cape York, northwest Greenland. Both wolves are recognized as separate
		  subspecies of Canis lupus in the taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). </h3>
		  
		  
		  <img src="AW.jpg" width=400 height=300>
		   
		   
		  <h2> Behaviour </h2>
		  
		  
		  <h3>The Arctic wolf is relatively unafraid of people, and can be coaxed to approach people in some areas. 
		  The wolves on Ellesmere Island do not fear humans, which is thought to be due to them seeing humans so little,
		  and they will approach humans cautiously and curiously.
		  Otto Sverdrup wrote that during the Fram expedition, a pair of wolves shadowed one of his teammates, who kept
		  them at a distance by waving his ski pole. In 1977, a pair of scientists were approached by six wolves on
		  Ellesmere Island, with one animal leaping at one of the scientists and grazing a cheek. A number of incidents 
		  involving aggressive wolves have occurred in Alert, Nunavut, where the wolves have lived in close proximity to 
		  the local weather station for decades and became habituated to humans. One of these wolves attacked 3 people, 
		  was shot, and tested positive for rabies. </h3>
		  
		  <h3>Very little is known about the movement of the Arctic wolves, mainly due to climate. The only time
		  at which the wolf migrates is during the wintertime when there is complete darkness for 24 hours. This
		  makes Arctic wolf movement hard to research. About 2,250 km (1,400 mi) south of the High Arctic, a wolf
		  movement study took place in the wintertime in complete darkness, when the temperature was as low as −53 
		  °C (−63 °F). The researchers found that wolves prey mainly on the muskoxen. There is no available information
		  of the wolves' movements where the muskoxen were. </h3>
		  
		  
		  <h2> Diet </h2>
		  
		  
		  <h3>In the wild, Arctic wolves primarily prey on muskoxen and Arctic hares. They have also been found
		  to prey on lemmings, caribou, Arctic foxes, birds, and beetles. It has been also found that Arctic wolves
		  scavenge through garbage. This sort of food source will not always be found in the Arctic wolf's diet because
		  of regional and seasonal availability. Sometimes there is debate whether the muskox or the Arctic hare
		  is the primary prey for the hare-wolf-muskox predator-prey system. Studies provide evidence that the muskoxen 
		  are indeed their primary prey because wolf presence and reproduction seems to be higher when muskox is more
		  available than higher hare availability. More supporting evidence suggests that muskoxen provide long-term
		  viability and other ungulates do not appear in the wolf's diet. Evidence suggesting that Arctic wolves
		  depend more on hares claims that the mature wolf population paralleled the increase of hares rather than muskoxen
		  availability. The study goes on to say that degree of reliance between the two sources of food is uncertain
		  and that the amount of consumption between the two species depends on the season and year. Debate continues
		  when seasonal and diet of young wolves is discussed. According to one study, muskox calves serve as a primary
		  food source because the needs of pups are greater but another study suggests that "when hares were much
		  more plentiful (Mech, 2000), wolves commonly fed them to their pups during summer." These differences
		  may be attributed to location as well. Polar bears are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two 
		  records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs.</h3>

		  <h3>The eastern wolf (Canis lycaon or Canis lupus lycaon 
		  or Canis rufus lycaon) also known as the timber wolf, Algonquin
		  wolf or eastern timber wolf, is a canine of debated taxonomy 
		  native to the Great Lakes region and southeastern Canada. </h3>

		  <h2> Taxonomy </h2>
		  
		  <h3>The first published name of a taxon belonging to the genus Canis from North 
		  America is Canis lycaon. It was published in 1775 by the German naturalist Johann Schreber, 
		  who had based it on the earlier description and illustration of one specimen that was thought
		  to have been captured near Quebec. It was later reclassified as a subspecies of gray wolf by
		  Edward Goldman. In the third edition of Mammal Species of the World published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher
          Wozencraft listed the eastern wolf as a gray wolf subspecies, which supports its earlier classification
          based on morphology in three studies. This taxonomic classification has since been debated. 
		  In 2021, the American Society of Mammalogists considered the eastern wolf as its own species (Canis lycaon).</h3>
		  
		  <h2> Description </h2>
		  
		  <h3> Charles Darwin was told that there were two types of wolf living in the Catskill Mountains,
		  one being a lightly-built, greyhound-like animal that pursued deer, and the other being a bulkier,
		  shorter-legged wolf. The eastern wolf's fur is typically of a grizzled grayish-brown coloration,
		  mixed with cinnamon. The flanks and chest are rufous or creamy, while the nape, shoulder and tail region
		  are a mix of black and gray. Unlike gray wolves, eastern wolves rarely produce melanistic individuals.
		  The first documented all-black eastern wolf was found to have been an eastern wolf–gray wolf hybrid.
		  Like the red wolf, the eastern wolf is intermediate in size between the coyote and gray wolf, with
		  females weighing 23.9 kilograms (53 lb) on average and males 30.3 kilograms (67 lb). Like the gray
		  wolf, its average lifespan is 3–4 years, with a maximum of 15 years. Their physical sizes that sets
		  them intermediate between gray wolves and coyotes are actually believed to be more related to their
		  adaptations to an environment with predominately medium-sized prey (similar to the case with the 
		  Mexican wolf in the southwestern US) rather than their close relationship to red wolves and coyotes.</h3>
		  
		  <h2> Ecology and behaviour </h2>
		  
		  <h3> The eastern wolf primarily targets small to medium-sized prey items like white-tailed deer and
		  beavers, unlike the gray wolf, which can effectively hunt large ungulates like caribou, elk, moose 
		  and bison. Despite being carnivores, packs in Voyageurs National Park forage for blueberries
		  in much of July and August, when the berries are in season. Packs carefully avoid each other;
		  only lone wolves sometimes enter other packs' territories. The average territory ranges
		  between 110–185 km², and the earliest age of dispersal for young eastern wolves is 15 weeks,
		  much earlier than gray wolves.</h3>

		  <h3> The northwestern wolf (Canis lupus occidentalis),
			also known as the Mackenzie Valley wolf, Alaskan timber wolf,
			or Canadian timber wolf, is a subspecies of gray wolf in western 
			North America. Arguably the largest grey wolf subspecies in the world,
			it ranges from Alaska, the upper Mackenzie River Valley; southward
			throughout the western Canadian provinces, aside from prairie landscapes
			in its southern portions, as well as the Northwestern United States. </h3>

		  <h2> Taxonomy </h2>
			
		  <h3>This wolf is recognized as a subspecies of Canis lupus in the 
			taxonomic authority Mammal Species of the World (2005). The 
			subspecies was first written of by Scottish naturalist Sir John 
			Richardson in 1829. He chose to give it the name occidentalis in
			reference to its geographic location rather than label it by its 
			color, as it was too variable to warrant such.

According to one source, phylogenetic analyses of North American gray wolves 
show that there are three clades corresponding to C. l. occidentalis, C. l.
 nubilus and C. l. baileyi, each one representing a separate invasion into
 North America from distinct Eurasian ancestors. C. l. occidentalis, the most
 northwestern subspecies, is descended from the last gray wolves to colonize
 North America. It likely crossed into North America through the Bering land
 bridge after the last ice age, displacing C. l. nubilus populations as it 
 advanced, a process which has continued until present times. Along with C. 
 l. nubilus, C. l. occidentalis is the most widespread member of the five gray 
 wolf subspecies in North America, with at least six different synonyms. </h3>
 
          <h2> Description </h2>
		 	
	      <h3>Northwestern wolves are one of the largest subspecies of wolves.
			In British Columbia, Canada, five adult females averaged 42.5 kg or
			93.6 lbs with a range of 85 lbs to 100 lbs (38.6 - 45.4 kg) and ten 
			adult males averaged 112.2 lbs or 51.7 kg with a range of 105 lbs to 
			135 lbs (47.6 - 61.2 kg), with a weight range for all adults of 38.6
			kg to 61.2 kg (85 - 135 lbs). In Yellowstone National Park, adult
			females were average about 40 kg (90 lbs) and adult males average about
			50 kg (110 lbs), with a mean adult body mass in winter of 46.4 kg (102
			lb). More recent studies have reported the average range of 
			height and weight in the north-west of the United States, both sexes
			were between 68 and 91.5 cm (26.8 and 36.0 in) tall at the shoulder.
			Here the weight of males was reported at between 45 and 72 kg (99 
			and 159 lb), while the females were reported at 36 to 60 kg (79 to 132 lb). </h3>
			
	      <h2> Reintroduction </h2>
			
		  <h3>In Yellowstone National Park, artificially relocated northwestern
			wolves have been well-documented feeding on elk. They usually stampede
			the herd using pack teamwork to separate the younger elk from the adults.
			They also will charge young calves separated from their parents. Winter-weakened 
			or sick elk also play an important part of Yellowstone wolf diets, and it is
			estimated that over 50 percent of winter-weakened or sick elk in Yellowstone 
			are killed by wolves. Of these, about 12 percent of carcasses were scavenged
			by other predators, including ravens, bald eagles, black bears, grizzly bears,
			and coyotes.[17] In the same national park, wolves also prey on bison, though
			such attacks usually involve sick animals or calves because healthy, adult 
			bison can easily kill wolves with their hooves. </h3>
